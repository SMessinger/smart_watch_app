     <dt>Samuel Messinger 	    (7006182)</dt>
        <dd>
        Sam has proficient knowledge of HTML and CSS, as a result of a few years of practice and study at university.
        He is confident in his ability to code in either Java or C, and mostly confident with C#. He does not have knowledge of SVG or the <canvas> element, and only limited knowledge with working with JavaScript. 
        Sam is more of a follower rather than a leader, and can be dedicated to a job when set on it. He is good at proof-reading and editing of work such as reports, but not as good as writing them in the first place.
        </dd>
     <dt>Finnegan Miles-Hussey (5453391)</dt>
        <dd> 
        Finnegan is confident working with Java &amp; C. He has working knowledge of HTML5 &amp; CSS. 
        He has little to no knowledge of JavaScript, SVG &amp; the &lt;canvas&gt; element. Can write the report with no issues.
        </dd>
     <dt>Robert Young          (3176240)</dt>
        <dd>
        Robert knows enough HTML/CSS to make a basic website and is familiar with Javascript. 
        He has working knowledge in C and Java along with some basic ability in C++ and Perl. 
        He doesn't know any JQuery, SVG or &lt;canvas&gt; at the moment, but he's currently learning them.

    <h2>Description of App</h2>
        <p>
            With such a small screen, reading on a smartwatch the conventional way could be difficult. 
            By printing one word to the screen at a time in quick succession, our application would implement Rapid Serial Visual
            Representation, an alternative method of reading that would be ideal for the small screen of a smartwatch.
            RSVR implementations such as Spritz and Spreeder have been created before, but, to our group’s knowledge,
            one hasn’t been created for the smartwatch. Our application would access text files from the smartwatch’s file system
            and present them to the user with easily customisable speeds and fonts.
            What makes our application good for our group is that it is easily scalable, significantly 
            decreasing our risk of failure. It could start out by interpreting .txt files before moving on to pdf, 
            docx, and epub files along with other ebook formats. Ideally, we hope to eventually give our 
            app HTML-reading capabilities, opening up the possibility of creating a primitive browser for the smartwatch.

    <h2>The Editor</h2>
        <p>
+            The team has chosen to use NetBeans, which is an open source code editor. We decided to use NetBeans as, first of all, it is able to run on both windows and OSX, which were necessary for our group. NetBeans also provides functionality such as syntax highlighting, code analysis and code completion, which is very easy to use, and features drag-and-drop functionality for quickly creating GUI's, which was an extra bonus.
+            NetBeans also features database support, including built-in functionality for SQL and Oracle. This editor also has a built in debugger, which allows you to inspect your code step-by-step to see where any issues are occurring. NetBeans also has additional support for JavaScript, the language we will be coding in, with it's integrated JavaScript editor.
+            Finally, NetBeans also has direct support for working with GitHub, making it much easier for the team to push/pull the project when needed. When any important change is made, we will be able to ‘push’ the project to the repository and instantly have a working backup.
